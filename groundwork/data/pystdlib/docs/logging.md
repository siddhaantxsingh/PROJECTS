# logging

## logging.BufferingFormatter(linefmt=None)

A formatter suitable for formatting a number of records.

## logging.BufferingFormatter.format(self, records)

Format the specified records and return the result as a string.

## logging.BufferingFormatter.formatFooter(self, records)

Return the footer string for the specified records.

## logging.BufferingFormatter.formatHeader(self, records)

Return the header string for the specified records.

## logging.FileHandler(filename, mode='a', encoding=None, delay=False, errors=None)

A handler class which writes formatted logging records to disk files.

## logging.FileHandler.close(self)

Closes the stream.

## logging.FileHandler.emit(self, record)

Emit a record. If the stream was not opened because 'delay' was specified in the
constructor, open it before calling the superclass's emit.

If stream is not open, current mode is 'w' and `_closed=True`, record
will not be emitted (see Issue #42378).

## logging.Filter(name='')

Loggers and Handlers can optionally use Filter instances to filter
records as desired. The base filter class only allows events which are
below a certain point in the logger hierarchy. For example, a filter
initialized with "A.B" will allow events logged by loggers "A.B",
"A.B.C", "A.B.C.D", "A.B.D" etc. but not "A.BB", "B.A.B" etc. If
initialized with the empty string, all events are passed.

## logging.Filter.filter(self, record)

Determine if the specified record is to be logged. Returns True if the record should be logged, or False otherwise.
If deemed appropriate, the record may be modified in-place.

## logging.Filterer()

A base class for loggers and handlers which allows them to share common code.

## logging.Filterer.addFilter(self, filter)

Add the specified filter to this handler.

## logging.Filterer.filter(self, record)

The default is to allow the record to be logged; any filter can veto
this by returning a false value.
If a filter attached to a handler returns a log record instance,
then that instance is used in place of the original log record in
any further processing of the event by that handler.
If a filter returns any other true value, the original log record
is used in any further processing of the event by that handler.

If none of the filters return false values, this method returns
a log record.
If any of the filters return a false value, this method returns
a false value.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2

Allow filters to be just callables.

.. versionchanged:: 3.12
   Allow filters to return a LogRecord instead of
   modifying it in place.

## logging.Filterer.removeFilter(self, filter)

Remove the specified filter from this handler.

## logging.Formatter(fmt=None, datefmt=None, style='%', validate=True, *, defaults=None)

Formatters need to know how a LogRecord is constructed. They are
responsible for converting a LogRecord to (usually) a string which can
be interpreted by either a human or an external system. The base Formatter
allows a formatting string to be specified. If none is supplied, the
style-dependent default value, "%(message)s", "{message}", or
"${message}", is used.

The Formatter can be initialized with a format string which makes use of
knowledge of the LogRecord attributes - e.g. the default value mentioned
above makes use of the fact that the user's message and arguments are pre-
formatted into a LogRecord's message attribute. Currently, the useful
attributes in a LogRecord are described by:

%(name)s            Name of the logger (logging channel)
%(levelno)s         Numeric logging level for the message (DEBUG, INFO,
                    WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
%(levelname)s       Text logging level for the message ("DEBUG", "INFO",
                    "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL")
%(pathname)s        Full pathname of the source file where the logging
                    call was issued (if available)
%(filename)s        Filename portion of pathname
%(module)s          Module (name portion of filename)
%(lineno)d          Source line number where the logging call was issued
                    (if available)
%(funcName)s        Function name
%(created)f         Time when the LogRecord was created (time.time_ns() / 1e9
                    return value)
%(asctime)s         Textual time when the LogRecord was created
%(msecs)d           Millisecond portion of the creation time
%(relativeCreated)d Time in milliseconds when the LogRecord was created,
                    relative to the time the logging module was loaded
                    (typically at application startup time)
%(thread)d          Thread ID (if available)
%(threadName)s      Thread name (if available)
%(taskName)s        Task name (if available)
%(process)d         Process ID (if available)
%(processName)s     Process name (if available)
%(message)s         The result of record.getMessage(), computed just as
                    the record is emitted

## logging.Formatter.format(self, record)

The record's attribute dictionary is used as the operand to a
string formatting operation which yields the returned string.
Before formatting the dictionary, a couple of preparatory steps
are carried out. The message attribute of the record is computed
using LogRecord.getMessage(). If the formatting string uses the
time (as determined by a call to usesTime(), formatTime() is
called to format the event time. If there is exception information,
it is formatted using formatException() and appended to the message.

## logging.Formatter.formatException(self, ei)

Format and return the specified exception information as a string. This default implementation just uses
traceback.print_exception()

## logging.Formatter.formatStack(self, stack_info)

The input data is a string as returned from a call to
:func:`traceback.print_stack`, but with the last trailing newline
removed.

The base implementation just returns the value passed in.

## logging.Formatter.formatTime(self, record, datefmt=None)

This method should be called from format() by a formatter which
wants to make use of a formatted time. This method can be overridden
in formatters to provide for any specific requirement, but the
basic behaviour is as follows: if datefmt (a string) is specified,
it is used with time.strftime() to format the creation time of the
record. Otherwise, an ISO8601-like (or RFC 3339-like) format is used.
The resulting string is returned. This function uses a user-configurable
function to convert the creation time to a tuple. By default,
time.localtime() is used; to change this for a particular formatter
instance, set the 'converter' attribute to a function with the same
signature as time.localtime() or time.gmtime(). To change it for all
formatters, for example if you want all logging times to be shown in GMT,
set the 'converter' attribute in the Formatter class.

## logging.Formatter.usesTime(self)

Check if the format uses the creation time of the record.

## logging.Handler(level=0)

The base handler class. Acts as a placeholder which defines the Handler
interface. Handlers can optionally use Formatter instances to format
records as desired. By default, no formatter is specified; in this case,
the 'raw' message as determined by record.message is logged.

## logging.Handler.acquire(self)

Acquire the I/O thread lock.

## logging.Handler.close(self)

This version removes the handler from an internal map of handlers,
_handlers, which is used for handler lookup by name. Subclasses
should ensure that this gets called from overridden close()
methods.

## logging.Handler.createLock(self)

Acquire a thread lock for serializing access to the underlying I/O.

## logging.Handler.emit(self, record)

Do whatever it takes to actually log the specified logging record. This version is intended to be implemented by subclasses and so
raises a NotImplementedError.

## logging.Handler.flush(self)

Ensure all logging output has been flushed. This version does nothing and is intended to be implemented by
subclasses.

## logging.Handler.format(self, record)

Format the specified record. If a formatter is set, use it. Otherwise, use the default formatter
for the module.

## logging.Handler.handle(self, record)

Emission depends on filters which may have been added to the handler.
Wrap the actual emission of the record with acquisition/release of
the I/O thread lock.

Returns an instance of the log record that was emitted
if it passed all filters, otherwise a false value is returned.

## logging.Handler.handleError(self, record)

This method should be called from handlers when an exception is
encountered during an emit() call. If raiseExceptions is false,
exceptions get silently ignored. This is what is mostly wanted
for a logging system - most users will not care about errors in
the logging system, they are more interested in application errors.
You could, however, replace this with a custom handler if you wish.
The record which was being processed is passed in to this method.

## logging.Handler.release(self)

Release the I/O thread lock.

## logging.Handler.setFormatter(self, fmt)

Set the formatter for this handler.

## logging.Handler.setLevel(self, level)

Set the logging level of this handler. level must be an int or a str.

## logging.LogRecord(name, level, pathname, lineno, msg, args, exc_info, func=None, sinfo=None, **kwargs)

LogRecord instances are created every time something is logged. They
contain all the information pertinent to the event being logged. The
main information passed in is in msg and args, which are combined
using str(msg) % args to create the message field of the record. The
record also includes information such as when the record was created,
the source line where the logging call was made, and any exception
information to be logged.

## logging.LogRecord.getMessage(self)

Return the message for this LogRecord. Return the message for this LogRecord after merging any user-supplied
arguments with the message.

## logging.Logger(name, level=0)

A "logging channel" indicates an area of an application. Exactly how an "area" is defined is up to the application developer. Since an application can have any number of areas, logging channels are identified by a unique string. Application areas can be nested (e.g. an area of "input processing" might include sub-areas "read CSV files", "read XLS files" and "read Gnumeric files"). To cater for this natural nesting, channel names are organized into a namespace hierarchy where levels are separated by periods, much like the Java or Python package namespace. So in the instance given above, channel names might be "input" for the upper level, and "input.csv", "input.xls" and "input.gnu" for the sub-levels. There is no arbitrary limit to the depth of nesting.

## logging.Logger.addHandler(self, hdlr)

Add the specified handler to this logger.

## logging.Logger.callHandlers(self, record)

Loop through all handlers for this logger and its parents in the
logger hierarchy. If no handler was found, output a one-off error
message to sys.stderr. Stop searching up the hierarchy whenever a
logger with the "propagate" attribute set to zero is found - that
will be the last logger whose handlers are called.

## logging.Logger.critical(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)

Log 'msg % args' with severity 'CRITICAL'. To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
a true value, e.g.

logger.critical("Houston, we have a %s", "major disaster", exc_info=True)

## logging.Logger.debug(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)

Log 'msg % args' with severity 'DEBUG'. To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
a true value, e.g.

logger.debug("Houston, we have a %s", "thorny problem", exc_info=True)

## logging.Logger.error(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)

Log 'msg % args' with severity 'ERROR'. To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
a true value, e.g.

logger.error("Houston, we have a %s", "major problem", exc_info=True)

## logging.Logger.exception(self, msg, *args, exc_info=True, **kwargs)

Convenience method for logging an ERROR with exception information.

## logging.Logger.fatal(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)

Don't use this method, use critical() instead.

## logging.Logger.findCaller(self, stack_info=False, stacklevel=1)

Find the stack frame of the caller so that we can note the source file name, line number and function name.

## logging.Logger.getChild(self, suffix)

This is a convenience method, such that

logging.getLogger('abc').getChild('def.ghi')

is the same as

logging.getLogger('abc.def.ghi')

It's useful, for example, when the parent logger is named using
__name__ rather than a literal string.

## logging.Logger.getEffectiveLevel(self)

Get the effective level for this logger. Loop through this logger and its parents in the logger hierarchy,
looking for a non-zero logging level. Return the first one found.

## logging.Logger.handle(self, record)

Call the handlers for the specified record. This method is used for unpickled records received from a socket, as
well as those created locally. Logger-level filtering is applied.

## logging.Logger.hasHandlers(self)

Loop through all handlers for this logger and its parents in the
logger hierarchy. Return True if a handler was found, else False.
Stop searching up the hierarchy whenever a logger with the "propagate"
attribute set to zero is found - that will be the last logger which
is checked for the existence of handlers.

## logging.Logger.info(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)

Log 'msg % args' with severity 'INFO'. To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
a true value, e.g.

logger.info("Houston, we have a %s", "notable problem", exc_info=True)

## logging.Logger.isEnabledFor(self, level)

Is this logger enabled for level 'level'?

## logging.Logger.log(self, level, msg, *args, **kwargs)

Log 'msg % args' with the integer severity 'level'. To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
a true value, e.g.

logger.log(level, "We have a %s", "mysterious problem", exc_info=True)

## logging.Logger.makeRecord(self, name, level, fn, lno, msg, args, exc_info, func=None, extra=None, sinfo=None)

A factory method which can be overridden in subclasses to create specialized LogRecords.

## logging.Logger.removeHandler(self, hdlr)

Remove the specified handler from this logger.

## logging.Logger.setLevel(self, level)

Set the logging level of this logger. level must be an int or a str.

## logging.Logger.warning(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)

Is this logger enabled for level 'level'?

## logging.LoggerAdapter.log(self, level, msg, *args, **kwargs)

Delegate a log call to the underlying logger, after adding contextual information from this adapter instance.

## logging.LoggerAdapter.process(self, msg, kwargs)

You can either manipulate the message itself, the keyword args or both. Return the message and kwargs modified (or not) to suit your needs.

Normally, you'll only need to override this one method in a
LoggerAdapter subclass for your specific needs.

## logging.LoggerAdapter.setLevel(self, level)

Set the specified level on the underlying logger.

## logging.LoggerAdapter.warning(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)

Delegate a warning call to the underlying logger.

## logging.Manager(rootnode)

There is [under normal circumstances] just one Manager instance, which holds the hierarchy of loggers.

## logging.Manager.getLogger(self, name)

This name is a dot-separated hierarchical name, such as "a", "a.b", "a.b.c" or similar.

If a PlaceHolder existed for the specified name [i.e. the logger
didn't exist but a child of it did], replace it with the created
logger and fix up the parent/child references which pointed to the
placeholder to now point to the logger.

## logging.Manager.setLogRecordFactory(self, factory)

Set the factory to be used when instantiating a log record with this Manager.

## logging.Manager.setLoggerClass(self, klass)

Set the class to be used when instantiating a logger with this Manager.

## logging.NullHandler(level=0)

This handler does nothing. It's intended to be used to avoid the "No handlers could be found for logger XXX" one-off warning. This is important for library code, which may contain code to log events. If a user of the library does not configure logging, the one-off warning might be produced; to avoid this, the library developer simply needs to instantiate a NullHandler and add it to the top-level logger of the library module or package.

## logging.NullHandler.emit(self, record)

Stub.

## logging.NullHandler.handle(self, record)

Stub.

## logging.PercentStyle.validate(self)

Validate the input format, ensure it matches the correct style

## logging.PlaceHolder(alogger)

PlaceHolder instances are used in the Manager logger hierarchy to take the place of nodes for which no loggers have been defined. This class is intended for internal use only and not as part of the public API.

## logging.PlaceHolder.append(self, alogger)

Add the specified logger as a child of this placeholder.

## logging.RootLogger(level)

A root logger is not that different to any other logger, except that it must have a logging level and there is only one instance of it in the hierarchy.

## logging.StrFormatStyle.validate(self)

Validate the input format, ensure it is the correct string formatting style

## logging.StreamHandler(stream=None)

A handler class which writes logging records, appropriately formatted, to a stream. Note that this class does not close the stream, as sys.stdout or sys.stderr may be used.

## logging.StreamHandler.emit(self, record)

Emit a record. If a formatter is specified, it is used to format the record.
The record is then written to the stream with a trailing newline.  If
exception information is present, it is formatted using
traceback.print_exception and appended to the stream.  If the stream
has an 'encoding' attribute, it is used to determine how to do the
output to the stream.

## logging.StreamHandler.flush(self)

Flushes the stream.

## logging.StreamHandler.setStream(self, stream)

Sets the StreamHandler's stream to the specified value, if it is different. Returns the old stream, if the stream was changed, or None
if it wasn't.

## logging.addLevelName(level, levelName)

Associate 'levelName' with 'level'. This is used when converting levels to text during message formatting.

## logging.basicConfig(**kwargs)

This function does nothing if the root logger already has handlers
configured, unless the keyword argument *force* is set to ``True``.
It is a convenience method intended for use by simple scripts
to do one-shot configuration of the logging package.

The default behaviour is to create a StreamHandler which writes to
sys.stderr, set a formatter using the BASIC_FORMAT format string, and
add the handler to the root logger.

A number of optional keyword arguments may be specified, which can alter
the default behaviour.

filename  Specifies that a FileHandler be created, using the specified
          filename, rather than a StreamHandler.
filemode  Specifies the mode to open the file, if filename is specified
          (if filemode is unspecified, it defaults to 'a').
format    Use the specified format string for the handler.
datefmt   Use the specified date/time format.
style     If a format string is specified, use this to specify the
          type of format string (possible values '%', '{', '$', for
          %-formatting, :meth:`str.format` and :class:`string.Template`
          - defaults to '%').
level     Set the root logger level to the specified level.
stream    Use the specified stream to initialize the StreamHandler. Note
          that this argument is incompatible with 'filename' - if both
          are present, 'stream' is ignored.
handlers  If specified, this should be an iterable of already created
          handlers, which will be added to the root logger. Any handler
          in the list which does not have a formatter assigned will be
          assigned the formatter created in this function.
force     If this keyword  is specified as true, any existing handlers
          attached to the root logger are removed and closed, before
          carrying out the configuration as specified by the other
          arguments.
encoding  If specified together with a filename, this encoding is passed to
          the created FileHandler, causing it to be used when the file is
          opened.
errors    If specified together with a filename, this value is passed to the
          created FileHandler, causing it to be used when the file is
          opened in text mode. If not specified, the default value is
          `backslashreplace`.

Note that you could specify a stream created using open(filename, mode)
rather than passing the filename and mode in. However, it should be
remembered that StreamHandler does not close its stream (since it may be
using sys.stdout or sys.stderr), whereas FileHandler closes its stream
when the handler is closed.

.. versionchanged:: 3.2
   Added the ``style`` parameter.

.. versionchanged:: 3.3
   Added the ``handlers`` parameter. A ``ValueError`` is now thrown for
   incompatible arguments (e.g. ``handlers`` specified together with
   ``filename``/``filemode``, or ``filename``/``filemode`` specified
   together with ``stream``, or ``handlers`` specified together with
   ``stream``.

.. versionchanged:: 3.8
   Added the ``force`` parameter.

.. versionchanged:: 3.9
   Added the ``encoding`` and ``errors`` parameters.

## logging.captureWarnings(capture)

If capture is true, redirect all warnings to the logging package. If capture is False, ensure that warnings are not redirected to logging but to their original destinations.

## logging.critical(msg, *args, **kwargs)

Log a message with severity 'CRITICAL' on the root logger. If the logger has no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a pre-defined format.

## logging.debug(msg, *args, **kwargs)

Log a message with severity 'DEBUG' on the root logger. If the logger has no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a pre-defined format.

## logging.disable(level=50)

Disable all logging calls of severity 'level' and below.

## logging.error(msg, *args, **kwargs)

Log a message with severity 'ERROR' on the root logger. If the logger has no handlers, call basicConfig() to add a console handler with a pre-defined format.

## logging.exception(msg, *args, exc_info=True, **kwargs)

Log a message with severity 'ERROR' on the root logger, with exception information. If the logger has no handlers, basicConfig() is called to add a console handler with a pre-defined format.

## logging.fatal(msg, *args, **kwargs)

Don't use this function, use critical() instead.

## logging.getHandlerByName(name)

Get a handler with the specified *name*, or None if there isn't one with that name.

## logging.getHandlerNames()

Return all known handler names as an immutable set.

## logging.getLevelName(level)

If the level is one of the predefined levels (CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING,
INFO, DEBUG) then you get the corresponding string. If you have
associated levels with names using addLevelName then the name you have
associated with 'level' is returned.

If a numeric value corresponding to one of the defined levels is passed
in, the corresponding string representation is returned.

If a string representation of the level is passed in, the corresponding
numeric value is returned.

If no matching numeric or string value is passed in, the string
'Level %s' % level is returned.

## logging.getLogRecordFactory()

Return the factory to be used when instantiating a log record.

## logging.getLogger(name=None)

Return a logger with the specified name, creating it if necessary. If no name is specified, return the root logger.

## logging.getLoggerClass()

Return the class to be used when instantiating a logger.

Set the factory to be used when instantiating a log record. :param factory: A callable which will be called to instantiate
a log record.

## logging.setLoggerClass(klass)
