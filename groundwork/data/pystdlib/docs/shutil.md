# shutil

## shutil.ExecError(...)

Raised when a command could not be executed

## shutil.ReadError(...)

Raised when an archive cannot be read

## shutil.RegistryError(...)

Raised when a registry operation with the archiving and unpacking registries fails

## shutil.SameFileError(...)

Raised when source and destination are the same file.

## shutil.SpecialFileError(...)

Raised when trying to do a kind of operation (e.g. copying) which is not supported on a special file (e.g. a named pipe)

## shutil.chown(path, user=None, group=None, *, dir_fd=None, follow_symlinks=True)

user and group can be the uid/gid or the user/group names, and in that case,
they are converted to their respective uid/gid.

If dir_fd is set, it should be an open file descriptor to the directory to
be used as the root of *path* if it is relative.

If follow_symlinks is set to False and the last element of the path is a
symbolic link, chown will modify the link itself and not the file being
referenced by the link.

## shutil.copy(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)

Return the file's destination.

The destination may be a directory.

If follow_symlinks is false, symlinks won't be followed. This
resembles GNU's "cp -P src dst".

If source and destination are the same file, a SameFileError will be
raised.

## shutil.copy2(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)

Copy data and metadata. Return the file's destination.

Metadata is copied with copystat(). Please see the copystat function
for more information.

The destination may be a directory.

If follow_symlinks is false, symlinks won't be followed. This
resembles GNU's "cp -P src dst".

## shutil.copyfile(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)

If follow_symlinks is not set and src is a symbolic link, a new
symlink will be created instead of copying the file it points to.

## shutil.copyfileobj(fsrc, fdst, length=0)

copy data from file-like object fsrc to file-like object fdst

## shutil.copymode(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)

If follow_symlinks is not set, symlinks aren't followed if and only
if both `src` and `dst` are symlinks.  If `lchmod` isn't available
(e.g. Linux) this method does nothing.

## shutil.copystat(src, dst, *, follow_symlinks=True)

Copy file metadata Copy the permission bits, last access time, last modification time, and
flags from `src` to `dst`. On Linux, copystat() also copies the "extended
attributes" where possible. The file contents, owner, and group are
unaffected. `src` and `dst` are path-like objects or path names given as
strings.

If the optional flag `follow_symlinks` is not set, symlinks aren't
followed if and only if both `src` and `dst` are symlinks.

## shutil.copytree(src, dst, symlinks=False, ignore=None, copy_function=<function copy2 at 0x7fc8a0053060>, ignore_dangling_symlinks=False, dirs_exist_ok=False)

If exception(s) occur, an Error is raised with a list of reasons.

If the optional symlinks flag is true, symbolic links in the
source tree result in symbolic links in the destination tree; if
it is false, the contents of the files pointed to by symbolic
links are copied. If the file pointed to by the symlink doesn't
exist, an exception will be added in the list of errors raised in
an Error exception at the end of the copy process.

You can set the optional ignore_dangling_symlinks flag to true if you
want to silence this exception. Notice that this has no effect on
platforms that don't support os.symlink.

The optional ignore argument is a callable. If given, it
is called with the `src` parameter, which is the directory
being visited by copytree(), and `names` which is the list of
`src` contents, as returned by os.listdir():

callable(src, names) -> ignored_names

Since copytree() is called recursively, the callable will be
called once for each directory that is copied. It returns a
list of names relative to the `src` directory that should
not be copied.

The optional copy_function argument is a callable that will be used
to copy each file. It will be called with the source path and the
destination path as arguments. By default, copy2() is used, but any
function that supports the same signature (like copy()) can be used.

If dirs_exist_ok is false (the default) and `dst` already exists, a
`FileExistsError` is raised. If `dirs_exist_ok` is true, the copying
operation will continue if it encounters existing directories, and files
within the `dst` tree will be overwritten by corresponding files from the
`src` tree.

## shutil.disk_usage(path)

Return disk usage statistics about the given path. Returned value is a named tuple with attributes 'total', 'used' and
'free', which are the amount of total, used and free space, in bytes.

## shutil.get_archive_formats()

Returns a list of supported formats for archiving and unarchiving. Each element of the returned sequence is a tuple (name, description)

## shutil.get_terminal_size(fallback=(80, 24))

For each of the two dimensions, the environment variable, COLUMNS
and LINES respectively, is checked. If the variable is defined and
the value is a positive integer, it is used.

When COLUMNS or LINES is not defined, which is the common case,
the terminal connected to sys.__stdout__ is queried
by invoking os.get_terminal_size.

If the terminal size cannot be successfully queried, either because
the system doesn't support querying, or because we are not
connected to a terminal, the value given in fallback parameter
is used. Fallback defaults to (80, 24) which is the default
size used by many terminal emulators.

The value returned is a named tuple of type os.terminal_size.

## shutil.get_unpack_formats()

Returns a list of supported formats for unpacking. Each element of the returned sequence is a tuple
(name, extensions, description)

## shutil.ignore_patterns(*patterns)

Function that can be used as copytree() ignore parameter. Patterns is a sequence of glob-style patterns
that are used to exclude files

## shutil.make_archive(base_name, format, root_dir=None, base_dir=None, verbose=0, dry_run=0, owner=None, group=None, logger=None)

'base_name' is the name of the file to create, minus any format-specific
extension; 'format' is the archive format: one of "zip", "tar", "gztar",
"bztar", or "xztar".  Or any other registered format.

'root_dir' is a directory that will be the root directory of the
archive; ie. we typically chdir into 'root_dir' before creating the
archive.  'base_dir' is the directory where we start archiving from;
ie. 'base_dir' will be the common prefix of all files and
directories in the archive.  'root_dir' and 'base_dir' both default
to the current directory.  Returns the name of the archive file.

'owner' and 'group' are used when creating a tar archive. By default,
uses the current owner and group.

## shutil.move(src, dst, copy_function=<function copy2 at 0x7fc8a0053060>)

This is similar to the Unix "mv" command. Return the file or directory's destination.

If dst is an existing directory or a symlink to a directory, then src is
moved inside that directory. The destination path in that directory must
not already exist.

If dst already exists but is not a directory, it may be overwritten
depending on os.rename() semantics.

os.rename() is preferably used if the source and destination are on the
same filesystem. In case os.rename() fails due to OSError (e.g. the user
has write permission to *dst* file but not to its parent directory),
this method falls back to using *copy_function* silently.
Symlinks are also recreated under the new name if os.rename() fails
because of cross filesystem renames.

It's recommended to use os.rename() if atomic move is strictly required.

The optional `copy_function` argument is a callable that will be used
to copy the source or it will be delegated to `copytree`.
By default, copy2() is used, but any function that supports the same
signature (like copy()) can be used.

A lot more could be done here...  A look at a mv.c shows a lot of
the issues this implementation glosses over.

## shutil.register_archive_format(name, function, extra_args=None, description='')

Registers an archive format. name is the name of the format. function is the callable that will be
used to create archives. If provided, extra_args is a sequence of
(name, value) tuples that will be passed as arguments to the callable.
description can be provided to describe the format, and will be returned
by the get_archive_formats() function.

## shutil.register_unpack_format(name, extensions, function, extra_args=None, description='')

Registers an unpack format. `name` is the name of the format. `extensions` is a list of extensions
corresponding to the format.

`function` is the callable that will be
used to unpack archives. The callable will receive archives to unpack.
If it's unable to handle an archive, it needs to raise a ReadError
exception.

If provided, `extra_args` is a sequence of
(name, value) tuples that will be passed as arguments to the callable.
description can be provided to describe the format, and will be returned
by the get_unpack_formats() function.

## shutil.rmtree(path, ignore_errors=False, onerror=None, *, onexc=None, dir_fd=None)

Recursively delete a directory tree. If dir_fd is not None, it should be a file descriptor open to a directory;
path will then be relative to that directory.
dir_fd may not be implemented on your platform.
If it is unavailable, using it will raise a NotImplementedError.

If ignore_errors is set, errors are ignored; otherwise, if onexc or
onerror is set, it is called to handle the error with arguments (func,
path, exc_info) where func is platform and implementation dependent;
path is the argument to that function that caused it to fail; and
the value of exc_info describes the exception. For onexc it is the
exception instance, and for onerror it is a tuple as returned by
sys.exc_info().  If ignore_errors is false and both onexc and
onerror are None, the exception is reraised.

onerror is deprecated and only remains for backwards compatibility.
If both onerror and onexc are set, onerror is ignored and onexc is used.

## shutil.unpack_archive(filename, extract_dir=None, format=None, *, filter=None)

Unpack an archive. `filename` is the name of the archive.

`extract_dir` is the name of the target directory, where the archive
is unpacked. If not provided, the current working directory is used.

`format` is the archive format: one of "zip", "tar", "gztar", "bztar",
or "xztar".  Or any other registered format.  If not provided,
unpack_archive will use the filename extension and see if an unpacker
was registered for that extension.

In case none is found, a ValueError is raised.

If `filter` is given, it is passed to the underlying
extraction function.

## shutil.unregister_unpack_format(name)

Removes the pack format from the registry.

## shutil.which(cmd, mode=1, path=None)

Given a command, mode, and a PATH string, return the path which conforms to the given mode on the PATH, or None if there is no such file. `mode` defaults to os.F_OK | os.X_OK. `path` defaults to the result
of os.environ.get("PATH"), or can be overridden with a custom search
path.
